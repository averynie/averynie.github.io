                    <p>When I was younger, my grandfather John Wetherhold passed from ALS, specifically bulbar ALS, which impaired his speech.</p>
                    <p>At eight years old, I took a vow of silence to honor him, raising money from friends and family. Catching the attention of the non-profit organization Project ALS, we created the Don't-Talk-a-Thon (DTAT).</p>
                    <p>Each year since then, during ALS awareness month, we ask others to take a vow of silence with us. Since the first DTAT, we have raised over $1M for ALS research.</p>

                <h2>Celebrity Involvement</h2>

                <article>
                        <p>I am immensely grateful for the opportunity to work with numerous celebrities who are fighting for a historically overlooked cause. Their support in raising funds and, notably,  awareness for ALS research has been critical.</p>
                        <p>Their involvement and dedication have truly made a difference in our efforts.</p>
                        <p>Below, you will find videos from some notable donors and spokespersons, including Ben Stiller, Christine Taylor, Matt Bomer, Hunter Doohan, and Sarah Silverman, who have each played a significant role in advancing our cause.</p>
